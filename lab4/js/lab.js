//One person picks a word

    //Input number of lines for the amount of letters in the word

//Guessers will choose a letter to guess

    //They have 6 guesses before the hangman is fully drawn 

//The letters that are correct are written on the specific line where the letter is supposed to be

//The letters that are incorrect are written on the side

    //A part of the body of the hangman will be drawn

//Guessers will keep guessing till their guesses are up or they figure out what the word is

    //If guessers know the word then they say it and if correct they win the game

        //If the guess of the word is wrong, they lose the game







//BELOW IS PRE STUFF//

}

function main() {
  console.log("Main function started.");
  // the code that makes everything happen
}

main();
