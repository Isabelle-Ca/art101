			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Task 1: Pseudocode an everyday task</h2>
					<p>Get a bowl of cereal</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Get bowl</li>
							<li>Pour desired cereal into bowl</li>
							<li>Pour milk</li>
							<li>Get spoon</li>
							<li>Enjoy</li>
						</ol>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Understanding what pseudocoding is and how to use it in JavaScript.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We were a little bit confused at first of how we were going to do this assignment especially when it came to the JavaScript. However, the lecture helped to explain what pseudocode is and then the directions became a little bit more clear.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>I think our JavaScript code came out great. We were able to solve any problems or confusions by working together.</p>
					<h2>Our Lists</h2>
					<h3>Task 2: Pseudocode a simple computer game - Hangman</h3>
					<p>We decided on the game Hangman and this is our list we created which is esencially listing off the mechanics/rules of the game.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>One person picks a word</li>
							<ul><li>Input number of lines for the amount of letters in the word</li></ul>
						<li>Guessers will choose a letter to guess</li>
							<ul><li>They have 6 guesses before the hangman is fully drawn</li></ul>
						<li>The letters that are correct are written on the specific line where the letter is supposed to be</li>
						<li>The letters that are incorrect are written on the side</li>
							<ul><li>A part of the body of the hangman will be drawn</li></ul>
						<li>Guessers will keep guessing till their guesses are up or they figure out what the word is</Li>
							<ul><li>If guessers know the word then they say it and if correct they win the game</li></ul>
								<ul><ul><li>If the guess of the word is wrong, they lose the game</li></ul></ul>
					</ol>
