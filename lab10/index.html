					<p>I felt pretty good about this lab. I felt like it was straightforward. I also think the lecture helped because I felt more familiar with the code since we did exerises in class. I didn't have to many troubles with my code. There was one small issue where I would click the button but nothing changed and the text would only appear and change once I refreshed the page each time. I looked over Wes Modes lab 10 on his website and there was only one small part in my JavaScript that wasn't correct when I compared it with his.</p>

					<p>Overall, I think this lab turned out well. I like that I keep learning code that makes my page interactive for the user.</p>
