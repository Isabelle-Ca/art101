					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I feel like I struggled with this lab. I was very confused because at first my code wasn't working and I was unsure of where exactly the code was supposed to go like whether certain parts were in HTML or if it was in the js. I was able to solve it by asking people in my section and mostly using wesbot to help to figure out what parts of my code were correct and the places that I needed to change.</p>

					<p>Overall, I think this lab turned out well. Even though I had some issues, I was able to resolve it using different methods and tools.</p>
