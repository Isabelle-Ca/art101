				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>I didn't have too many problems when completing this assignment. There wasn't anything that needed a whole lot of work on. I just mostly worked on the CSS and moved things around in HTML so that things on the page were consistent.</p>

				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>Overall, I think this lab turned out well. I was able to complete the assignment with not many issues. I like that I was able to look back and see the work I've done and see where I'm at now. I also like that I was able to organize some things and make the pages look more alike.</p>
