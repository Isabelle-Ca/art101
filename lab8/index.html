			<h1>Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
			<div>
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with your partner, experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks.</p>
			</div>

			<div>
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>This was a little bit of a more confusing lab compared to the rest for me. I think it was just confusing going between the console and my webpage and making sure everything showed up.</p>
			</div>

			<div>
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Overall, I think this lab turned out well. I asked my partner when I had questions and that was helpful. I think the results came out well and you can see the array in my console.</p>
