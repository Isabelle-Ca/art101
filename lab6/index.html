					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>I didn't have too many challenges when completing this lab. I think the one part that I struggled with was the console because I was confused with how to indent. I solved this by first writing it in JavaScript and then coping it into my console.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I didn't have to many problems besides the console part which I was able to figure out. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>I think this lab turned out well. I think I'm still trying to figure out css and what I want my website to look like. I want it to be cohesive and nice. Overall, I think the labs are going well and my experience with JavaScript has been simple and straightforward. The directions have helped with this because they are guiding me step by step. </p>
