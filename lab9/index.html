					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I feel like I struggled with this lab. I was very confused because at first my code wasn't working and I was unsure of where exactly the code was supposed to go like whether certain parts were in HTML or if it was in the js. I was able to solve it, however, by asking my partner and mostly using wesbot and using other AI help to figure out my code.</p>

					<p>Overall, I think this lab turned out well. Even though I had some issues, I was able to resolve it using different methods and tools.</p>
