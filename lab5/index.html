					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>I didn't have too many challenges with this lab. I think before going fully into the assignmetn and reading the directions, I was worried that this was going to be a very challenging lab for me because I'm not as used to JavaScript as I am with HTML and CSS. Even though I was feeling this way, I was able to complete the assignment with no troubles. Any questions that I had I was able to discuss it with my partner.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I didn't have too many problems. Ones that come to mind are understanding what some of the code really means - like "document.writeln".</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>I think the results came out good and the code worked out. I followed the directions step by step and everything came out right. </p>
